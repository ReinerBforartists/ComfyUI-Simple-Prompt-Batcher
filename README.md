# ComfyUI Simple Prompt Batcher

A simple and efficient ComfyUI custom node that allows you to batch process multiple prompts in a single queue. Perfect for testing variations, exploring different ideas, or running systematic prompt experiments.

## 📋 Features

- ✅ **Simple text input** - One prompt per line, no complex syntax
- ✅ **Automatic batching** - All prompts run in a single queue
- ✅ **Optimized performance** - Models stay loaded between inferences
- ✅ **Unlimited prompts** - Add as many lines as you need
- ✅ **Clean console output** - Shows prompt count and preview
- ✅ **No empty lines** - Automatically filters blank entries

## 🚀 Installation

### Manual Installation
1. Navigate to your ComfyUI custom nodes directory:
   ```bash
   cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes/
   ```

2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ai-joe-git/ComfyUI-Simple-Prompt-Batcher.git
   ```

3. Restart ComfyUI

4. The node will appear as **"📝 Simple Prompt Batcher"** in the node menu under `utils/text`

## 💡 Usage

### Basic Workflow

1. **Add the node** to your workflow
   - Search for "Simple Prompt Batcher" or "📝 Simple Prompt Batcher"
   - Add it to your canvas

2. **Enter your prompts** in the text area (one per line):
   ```
   a beautiful sunset over mountains
   a cat sleeping on a couch
   a futuristic city at night
   a serene forest landscape
   ```

3. **Connect the output** to CLIPTextEncode (or any text input node)
   ```
   [Simple Prompt Batcher] → [CLIPTextEncode] → [Your Workflow]
   ```

4. **Queue the prompt ONCE** - ComfyUI will automatically run all prompts in sequence

### Example Workflow Structure

```
📝 Simple Prompt Batcher

Save Image
```

## 📊 Performance Benefits

### Without Batching
- Load models (30s) → Generate (25s) → Unload
- **Repeat for each prompt**
- **8 prompts = ~7 minutes 20 seconds**

### With Simple Prompt Batcher
- Load models once (30s) → Generate all 8 (8 × 25s)
- Models stay loaded between generations
- **8 prompts = ~3 minutes 50 seconds**

**Result: ~50% time savings on batch processing!** 🎯
